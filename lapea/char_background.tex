\chapter{background}
Your character's \emph{Legacy} represents the traits passed
along by their bloodline. Some families are known for their
strength, martial prowess, or an afinity for certain animals.
In a way this, along with their statistics, represt what a
character is by nature. Not every character has a Legacy that
provides unusual abilities, but those that do come in several
grades, showing how strongly this Legacy effects their growth
and abilities.

Additionally, the environment one grows up in can have a strong impact on
devlopment. This element is called \emph{Background} and
provides some basic skills and perhaps feats that your charater
begins with even before they enter training. These skills can
allways be purchased as if they were skills belonging to your
class, even if your class normally wouldnt' give acess to them.

\section{legacies}
People who bear these legacies, called `Inheritors,' bear
physical and psychological traits of them. These traits are not
allways visible, and even if percieved, their significance isn't
necesarily obvious.

Most legacies fall into broad groups, and the list below tries
to follow this. The last section includes guidelines for
creating your own.
\subsection{elemental}
These legacies are tied to the percieved elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water.
