\chapter{creation}
The essential process for character creation runs as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Generate statistics.
\item Select background \& legacy.
\item Choose a basic class.
\item Pick initial feats.
\item Aquire skills.
\item Generate hit points, Ki pool and action points.
\end{enumerate}
You will find these steps correlate roughly to the remaining
chapters in Part I. Each time a charater aquires a new level, 
the last four steps will, in a modified form, be repeated.
