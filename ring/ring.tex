\section{History}
Perhaps the wrong term for this.
History is the events that have unfolded, and our story begins before that time.
Sometimes, it survives, distorted, as myth and legend.
More often, it was simply forgotten and new stories were invented to fill the obvious gaps left in the narrative.
So, before all that is known, the following is supposition, backed with evidence.
\subsection{Primordial Epoch}
Long ago, but not so long ago that relatively few new worlds have formed since then, there was a civilization that dominated the galaxy.
`Primordials' is the term used in this work, though `Progenitor', `Creators', `Gods', `Demons', and `Ancients' fit in their own way.
Every world visited in a system past the 'Heavy Bombardment' stage of development with a solid crust shows sighs not only of having been visited but inhabited.
This puts the date of their disappearance between around 0.25-100 million years ago.
Many, tho not all, of those worlds show evidence of catastrophic transformations on planetary and in some cases system-wide scales.
K-2 levels of energy utilization are not unheard of in estimation of the power requirements in the most extreme examples.

Disappearance is perhaps the wrong word.
It is suspected that, due to underlying similarities in genetics and biochemistry, nearly all of the species making up The Culture are descended from species used by the Primordials if not the Primordials themselves.
The second great legacy of the Primordials is Grist. 
What can be stated is that there was a rapid and disruptive transformation throughout the Primordial civilization that, combined with the passage of time, has destroyed whatever records they may have kept about themselves.
