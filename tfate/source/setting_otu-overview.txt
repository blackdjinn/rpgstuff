The OTU (Official Traveller Universe,) is a Science Fiction setting based on the works of H. Beam Piper and Issac Azimov et al. with a dollop of age-of-sail pulp added in for fun. It dates from the earliest, darkest days of RPGs, having been in publication or development since the mid 1970s. Published adventures span some 1400 years of history from the birth to the death and aftermath of the Third Imperium.

Our game is starting in 1105. The Imperium seems to be at the height of it's power but the stress is starting to show, creating an opportunity for the Zhodani Consulate and Aslan Hierate to take advantage of the fading strength of this Empire and expand.

The stage for our game, at least initially, is the Spinward Marches, a frontier area controlled by the Zhodani Consulate and the Third Imperium, as well as a number of smaller buffer states that exist between the two large empires. On the Imperial side, the area is administered by Duke Norris of Regina as part of the Domain of Deneb. Over the last few hundred years, four 'Frontier Wars' have been fought between the forces of the two great powers, resulting in the establishment of the current borders.
